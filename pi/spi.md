SPI/JTAG tile

#Mounting

When using the SPI/JTAG tile board, it is important to mount the tile board in the correct direction. The jtag pins should face outside, as the picture illustated.

When plugin the flash adapter, do as this picture illustrated. The falsh should be mounted on the bottom part of the adapter. There is one dot on the flash, be sure to let it in the correct corner.
